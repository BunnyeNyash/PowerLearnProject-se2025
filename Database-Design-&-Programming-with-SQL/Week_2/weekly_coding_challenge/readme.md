# 🎬 Movie Database Challenge

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, I was tasked with building and querying a simple database to store information about movies and actors.  I had to create two tables:
- **Movies**: Contains information about movies.
- **Actors**: Contains information about actors.

## 📝 Table Structures

### **Actors Table 🌟**
The **Actors** table will store details about each actor.

| Column | Data Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| id     | INT       | A unique ID for each actor 🎭 |
| name   | VARCHAR   | The actor’s name ✨ |
| age    | INT       | The actor's age 🎂 |

### **Movies Table 🎥**
The **Movies** table will store details about each movie.

| Column | Data Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| id     | INT       | A unique ID for each movie 🎟️ |
| title  | VARCHAR   | The name of the movie 🎬 |
| year   | INT       | The release year of the movie 📅 |
