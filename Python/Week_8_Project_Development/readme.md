# 📝 Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
In this project, learners will build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.

By the end, they’ll have a data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## 🚩 Project Objectives:
✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data

✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)

✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions

✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps

✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## 🗂️ Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- **Goal**: Obtain a reliable COVID-19 dataset.

✅ **Data Sources**:
- [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#coronavirus-country-profiles) (CSV & API)
- [Johns Hopkins University GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

👉 **Recommended for Beginners**: Use the cleaned CSV from Our World in Data (`owid-covid-data.csv`), which is easy to load with pandas.

✅ **Action**:
- Download `owid-covid-data.csv` from the Our World in Data link.
- Save it in your working folder.


### 2️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration
- **Goal**: Load the dataset and explore its structure.

✅ **Tasks**:
- Load data using `pandas.read_csv()`.
- Check columns with: `df.columns`.
- Preview rows with: `df.head()`.
- Identify missing values with: `df.isnull().sum()`.

✅ **Tools**:
- `pandas`

📌 **Key Columns**:
- `date`, `location`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `new_cases`, `new_deaths`, `total_vaccinations`, etc.

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- **Goal**: Prepare data for analysis.

✅ **Tasks**:
- Filter countries of interest (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).
- Drop rows with missing dates or critical values.
- Convert `date` column to datetime using `pd.to_datetime()`.
- Handle missing numeric values with `fillna()` or `interpolate()`.

✅ **Tools**:
- `pandas`

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Goal**: Generate descriptive statistics and explore trends.

✅ **Tasks**:
- Plot total cases over time for selected countries.
- Plot total deaths over time.
- Compare daily new cases between countries.
- Calculate death rate: `total_deaths / total_cases`.

✅ **Visualizations**:
- Line charts (cases & deaths over time).
- Bar charts (top countries by total cases).
- Heatmaps (optional, for correlation analysis).

✅ **Tools**:
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

### 5️⃣ Visualizing Vaccination Progress
- **Goal**: Analyze vaccination rollouts.

✅ **Tasks**:
- Plot cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.
- Compare percentage of vaccinated population.

✅ **Charts**:
- Line charts.
- Optional: Pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations.

✅ **Tools**:
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`


### 6️⃣ Optional: Build a Choropleth Map
**Goal**: Visualize cases or vaccination rates by country on a world map.

✅ **Tools**:
- plotly.express
- `geopandas` (advanced)

✅ **Tasks**:
- Prepare a dataframe with `iso_code` and `total_cases` for the latest date.
- Plot a choropleth map showing case density or vaccination rates.


### 7️⃣ Insights & Reporting
- **Goal**: Summarize findings.

✅ **Tasks**:
- Write 3-5 key insights from the data (e.g., "X country had the fastest vaccine rollout").
- Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.
- Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to write a narrative.

✅ **Deliverables**:
- A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook** containing:
  - Code
  - Visualizations
  - Narrative explanations
- Optional: Export the notebook to PDF or create a PowerPoint with screenshots.


## 🛠️ Recommended Tools
✅ **Jupyter Notebook** (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)

✅ **pandas** for data manipulation

✅ **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualizations

✅ **plotly** or **geopandas** for advanced visualizations (optional)
