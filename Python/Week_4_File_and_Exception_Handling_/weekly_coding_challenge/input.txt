Hello, my name is Winter.
I am 20 years old, and will be turning 21 this coming May. I am really excited.
I am a college student, in her third year of college.
I have got three siblings, one brother and two sisters.
I love coding. Coding feels like life to me. It helps me make use of my creative mind.
I love cooking and love cooking shows to the moon and back.
My favorite go to activity is anything related to art, craft, and music, or anything to do with gun ranges and racing circuits.
